                            Linked Data Principle
                        </h2>
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>The term Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing structured data on
                                the Web. These principles have been coined by Tim Berners-Lee in the design issue note
                                Linked Data.</p>
                            <p>It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF and URIs, but rather than
                                using them to serve web pages only for human readers, it extends them to share
                                information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. Part of the vision of
                                linked data is for the Internet to become a global database.
                                Linked data may also be open data, in which case it is usually described as linked open
                                data (LOD). <br /> The priciples are:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="list-group mb-2">
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">Use URIs as
                                    names for things</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">Use HTTP
                                    URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">When
                                    someone looks up a URI, provide useful information</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">Include
                                    links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The idea behind these principles is on the one hand side, to use standards for the
                                representation and the access to data on the Web. On the other hand, the principles
                                propagate to set hyperlinks between data from different sources. These hyperlinks
                                connect all Linked Data into a single global data graph,
                                similar as the hyperlinks on the classic Web connect all HTML documents into a single
                                global information space. Thus, LinkedData is to spreadsheets and databases what the Web
                                of hypertext documents is to word processor files. The Linked Open Data cloud diagramms
                                give an overview of the linked data sets that are available on the Web.
                            </p>
                            <p>Tim Berners-Lee later restated these principles at a 2009 TED conference, again
                                paraphrased along the following:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group mb-2">
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">All
                                    conceptual things should have a name starting with HTTP.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">Looking up
                                    an HTTP name should return useful data about the thing in question in a standard
                                    format.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">Anything
                                    else that that same thing has a relationship with through its data should also be
                                    given a name beginning with HTTP.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Linked open data</h5>
                            <p>Linked open data are linked data that are open data. Tim Berners-Lee gives the clearest
                                definition of linked open data in differentiation with linked data.
                                "Linked Open Data (LOD) is Linked Data which is released under an open license, which
                                does not impede its reuse for free." — Tim Berners-Lee, Linked Data</p>
                            <p>Large linked open data sets include DBpedia and Wikidata.</p>
                            <p>Tim Berners-Lee has suggested a 5-star scheme for grading the quality of open data on the
                                web, for which the highest ranking is Linked Open Data:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group mb-2">
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">1 star:
                                    data is openly available in some format. </li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">2 stars:
                                    data is available in a structured format, such as Microsoft Excel file format
                                    (.xls).</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">3 stars:
                                    data is available in a non-proprietary structured format, such as Comma-separated
                                    values (.csv).</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">4 stars:
                                    data follows W3C standards, like using RDF and employing URIs.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-secondary">5 stars:
                                    all of the other, plus links to other Linked Open Data sources.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The goal of the W3C Semantic Web Education and Outreach group's Linking Open Data
                                community project is to extend the Web with a data commons by publishing various open
                                datasets as RDF on the Web and by setting RDF links between data items from different
                                data sources. In October 2007, datasets consisted of over two billion RDF triples, which
                                were interlinked by over two million RDF links.
                                By September 2011 this had grown to 31 billion RDF triples, interlinked by around 504
                                million RDF links. A detailed statistical breakdown was published in 2014.

                                    <p>
                                        Final users are persons who ultimately use or are intended to ultimately use our
                                        product. They can access the services offered by our application.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For example, a person passionate about art who can easily visualize artistic
                                        elements in the
                                        form of images from a wide range of representations. It provides access to a
                                        large comprehensive database through the search engine. You can configure the
                                        artistic fields of interest in a simple way based on keywords and the
                                        application provides relevant recommendations about the desired art.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition, a programmer who develops an art-based application and finds our
                                        approach
                                        appropriate as a way to integrate as a service exposed by our api. The
                                        application can also contain elements that inspire him in developing a similar
                                        application.

                                    <h3>Data</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The main source of data for the application is DBpedia.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The data will be retrieved from DBpedia by calling the sparql endpoint exposed
                                        progamatically using the Apache Jena library.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The data will be retrieved by using parametrized sparql queries built in the
                                        backend services and sent to the data source by apache jena and then by parsing
                                        the results in order to gather even more information for each resource that was
                                        retrieved using the initial query, namely:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Resource's label</li>
                                        <li>Resource's abstract</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    that will make up the overview the user will see about each resource
                                    </p>
                                </section>

                                    <h3>Front-end</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The application front-end is implemented in Vue.js and is styled with bootstrap
                                        in order to provide the best UX and customer friendly experience.
                                        Also, it's worth pointing out that the frontend application is <abbr>SPA</abbr>,
                                        and a side bar with the available options is presented to the user in order to
                                        allow him to navigate to the different options and features provided by the
                                        application.
                                        On a more technical side of things, the interaction between the frontend side
                                        and the backend side is done through AJAX requests which are handled by the
                                        backend, and once a response is received, the forntend will update the current
                                        page accordingly
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The frontend application is made up of the following components:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Authentication/Registration</li>
                                        <li>
                                            Main UI:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Navigation</li>
                                                <li>Profile</li>
                                                <li>Explore</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    For more details please see the user guide.
                                    </p>

                                        <h4>Authentication/Registration</h4>
                                        <p>The authentication/Registraction allows the user to enter his
                                            username/password combination in order to access the application, or create
                                            a new account if he isn't already on the platform</p>

                                        Why: In order to make the application work, the user's metadata(skills, interests and
                                        location/age/name) will be stored in a relational database.

                                    <section>
                                        <h4>Authentication service</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            This service will check the user's credentials in order to make sure he is
                                            an already existing customer of the platform. If the user is a new one, the
                                            application allows the user to generate an account by using an
                                            username/password combination.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            From a technical point of view, this service will work using JWT token. The
                                            front-end, will make, on behalf of the user a 'log-in'
                                            request to this service, and the said service will check the credentials,
                                            and if they are fine(that is, this user's credentials are already present in
                                            the database)
                                            then it will generate a JWT token for the user and send it back to him in
                                            the response's payload.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This JWT token will keep, besides an validity timeframe, metadata about the
                                            user like: the geographical location, its name etc and the preferences it
                                            has selected in the frontend UI.

                                                This service, through the endpoints it will expose, will provide the
                                                main functionality for the frontend part.
                                            </p>

                                            <h5>Functionality</h5>
                                            <p>
                                                The resource gathering implementation for the said endpoint is generic,
                                                allowing the frontend to build the subject, predicate or object of the
                                                request that will be made to the DBpedia's sparql endpoint as it sees
                                                fit.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>For each resource that's returned by dbpedia, the implementation for this
                                                endpoin will make another two requests in an attempt to retrieve the
                                                abstract and label for that specific resource, which will be used by the
                                                frontend application to generate an overview of the said resource.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Furthermore, all the requests that will be made to this service will be
                                                checked for the JWT token that is mandatory.
                                                In case the token isn't present, the request will be rejected.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Another feature provided by this service is represented by the
                                                comparison capabilities between two sets of content returned by the data
                                                source.
                                                Basically, the service will retrieve the right data for the two input
                                                and generate a difference between them.
                                                The response will contain the differences between the two resources.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                To retrieve the data, this service will make send sparql queries to some
                                                sparql endpoints exposed by the sources from which the data will be
                                                gathered.

                                                This service will take into account the reliability and fault tolerance
                                                of the sparql endpoints that are exposed and queried when a request gets
                                                processed.
                                                Therefor, the application will attempt a retry if a request to the
                                                dbpedia's endpoints fails.

                                            This service will expose a set of endpoints that will be called by the front
                                            end in order to allow the user to manage its profile and data.
                                            The endpoints exposed by this service, which will be called by the front end
                                            application, the user will be able to change/modify:

                                            All this metadata inserted by the user: location, skills and interests will
                                            be used by the application to retrieve the resources that will be shown to
                                            the user.
                                            As described in the architecture, the application, when first loading the
                                            page that lets the user explore the dbpedia resources, will gather all the
                                            relevant resources based on the user's defined skills and interests.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As with the other services, each request will be validated by checking that
                                            the JWT token is present in it.
                                        </p>

                                                This service will expose a single endpoint, that will receive as input
                                                the user's pereferences and other input data provided by him and will
                                                sent back a list of
                                                recommended data and genres of interest.

                                            <p>The recommendations are generated based on the seeAlso label the
                                                resources from dbpedia have.</p>
                                            <p>In other words, the recommendation service will receive a list of the
                                                current resources that are already shown to the user and which were
                                                generated by using the interests and skills metadata or by a previoys
                                                query.</p>
                                            <p>For each of the received resource from the frontend the service will call
                                                the main service in order to get resources from dbpedia which will be
                                                displayed to the user as recommended resources. </p>
                                            <p>When the recommendation service calls the main service, it's input will
                                                be formatted in such a way that the resources returned by the main
                                                service from dbpedia will be for the triple

                                                This endpoint will be called by the front-end application when it has to

                                                It goes without saying, that any request made to the endpoint exposed by
                                                the service will be valided in order to make sure the user is

                            <h3>Performance</h3>
                            <p>
                                Due to the way the services are called, for each search the user makes, the
                                performance of the application isn't that great partly because dbpedia's
                                response times are very high.
                                For example, if the first request made to the main service returns 30
                                resource, for each of that resource another request will be made to the
                                recommendation service, ending with 30*30=900 requests to dbpedia.
                                Because of this, the application isn't that scalable but the bottleneck in
                                this case is dbpedia's sparql endpoint and there is little we can do about
                                it other than trying to scale horizontally in order to at least try to get
                                more out of the said sparql endpoint.
                            </p>
                            <p>The user can mitigate this low performance by constraining the number of
                                resources that dbpedia will query for using the limit dropdown from the UI
                            </p>

                            <p>The services are used parametriezed sparql queries that can be customized by the frontend.</p>
                            <p>Basically, the frontend(or any other service for that matter) can call the main service with:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Query subject</li>
                                    <li>Query predicate</li>
                                    <li>Query object</li>
                                    <li>Country code</li>
                                    <li>Results limit</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>The service will build the sparql queries using the given data or with default values if nothing was given for a specific value</p>

                                    Java is the main programming language that is going to be used to implement the said
                                    services.
                                    By running on the platform the Java language provides, all the services that make up
                                    the backend side of the application
                                    are able to reap the benefits of all the libraries and frameworks that already
                                    exist, and increase their reliability, security and performance by doing so.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Spring, Spring Boot</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Spring Boot will be used thanks to it's flawless support and integration with the
                                    Java programming language and Apache Jena.
                                    Spring Boot is an application built on top of Sprin. Spring Boot will autoconfigure
                                    all the loose ends provided by Spring in order to ease the development of web
                                    applications.
                                    These autoconfiguration capabilities Spring Boot has are quite advanced, Spring Boot
                                    being able to compute the right way Spring should be configured based on the
                                    libraries that are being used;
                                    for example: if Spring Boot detects that the spring-boot-starter-web starter packge
                                    was used, then it will set up all the required stuff for Spring to be able to
                                    responde to client's requests.
                                    If in the previous example, Spring Boot would have detected a
                                    spring-boot-starter-security package, then it would have configured Spring in such a
                                    way that all the requests for all the endpoints exposed would require credentials.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Apache Jena</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Apache Jena is an open source library that will be unsed in order to query the
                                    DBpedia's sparql endpoint and work with the resources returned by it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to the said capabilities of Apache Jena to interogate a sparql endpoint,
                                    the bidar application takes full advaantage of the parsing capabilities of Apache
                                    Jena too.
                                    For example, for every request made to dbpedia, Apache Jena is used to extract the
                                    data from the response in order for the application to be able to build the final
                                    response that will be send to the user.
                                    Moreover, the way the response is parsed allows the backend service to extract all
                                    the data for each resource, regardless of the number of variables for a specific
                                    resource.

                                    VueJS is a javascript framework that can be used to build web applications in a more
                                    maintainable way thanks to the fact that it supports components.
                                    The Bidar application thanks full advantage of the components capabilities of this
                                    framework, and breaks the UI into seperate, manageble pieces that were joined
                                    together in order to produce the final results.
                                    Another feature of VueJS that was used in the application was the two-way data
                                    binding that allows the application to react to every change initiated by the user,
                                    e.g: when a new search is done by the user to update the resources based on the
                                    newly found ones which were returned by the main service.

                                    H2 is a relational databased implemented in Java with a vast set of features.
                                    H2 has support for all the common features one might expected from a relational
                                    database, but it also can be used as an in-memory database, which can speed things
                                    up during the development.
                                    In the project, H2 was used to store user related data, like: credentials,
                                    interests, and other profile data.
